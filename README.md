# DiscordBot
Discord Bot that responds to commands and certain phrases.
  
  The code starts by doing a connectivity check. In the server you will see the status of the bot "Hilltop Gang". 
  In the terminal it will report who has left/joined the server. 
  
  
The command prefix is set to "." Example: If a user on your server wants to play Magic 8 Ball the user must type ".8ball <question>"
  The bot also had administrator capabilities. To clear spam, for example, you type: .clear X (replace x with whatever you want)
  - The default limit is set to 1. So it will only clear your command. So if you need to clear 10 lines. you must specify 11 for X
